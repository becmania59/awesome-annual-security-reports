# Awesome Annual Security Reports [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
> A curated list of annual cyber security reports - Centralized annual cybersecurity analysis and industry surveys

**Definition:** The state of being secure has a temporal dimension which security vendors utilize to stay relevant through annual reports. CIO, CISO, and security leaders are faced with the challenge of sifting the valuable information from marketing material. In addition to filtering for type of information leaders are challenged with staying abreast of new security vendors and partnerships. This list seeks to lower the barrier for access to this information while remaining agnostic to providers.

**Disclaimer:** The reports in this collection are limited to content which does not require a paid subscription, membership, or service contract. There are a variety of different business models and drivers that would cause information to be put behind a paywall, I would like to respect those companies and individuals. Consult the original authors for licensing of any report content.

**Limitations:** This is **not** a collection of project based information such as white papers, intelligence reports, technical specifications, or standards. I welcome all user submitted uploads or report requests, but we should draw a box around this _awesome_ list. All reports will be sourced from the original author when possible and uploaded to [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) for an additional level of confidence, result link will be included in the readme.md commit notes.

**Acknowledgement:** I would like to give recognition for other works that inspired this collection. [Richard Stiennon](https://it-harvest.com/about/) and his annual analysis of the cybersecurity industry is much more comprehensive than this repository. [Rick Howard](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/author/rick/) and his cyber cannon list of must read books is a tremendous resource, at both leadership and practitioner levels.
